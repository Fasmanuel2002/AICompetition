BFRBS, its about self-directed habits involving repetitive actions, when frequent or intense, can cause physical harm and psychosocial challanges. For this the Child Mind has developed a wrist-worn device "Helios", desinged to detect these behaviors. It has 5 sensors, including 5 thermopiles(for detecting body heat) and 5 time-of-flight sensors(for detecting proximity).

The kids started to do geastures wearing the Helios device 

1.They began a transition from “rest” position and moved their hand to the appropriate location (Transition);

2.They followed this with a short pause wherein they did nothing (Pause); and

3.Finally they performed a gesture from either the BFRB-like or non-BFRB-like category of movements (Gesture; see Table below).
